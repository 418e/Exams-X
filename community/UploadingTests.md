# Guide to adding new tests

### Step 1

Turn pdf file of the test and its answers into the png.

[]

### Step 2

Create `{subject}_{year}_{version}` and `{subject}_{year}_{version}_answers` folders in the `/exams-x.com/public` directory. Replace `{subject}` with the subject of the test (Math, English, Biology....), `{year}` and `{version}` with year and versions of the tests.

### Step 3

Locate png versions of the problems in the `/exams-x.com/public/{subject}_{year}_{version}` and rename them according to their number. (for example: N7 problem would be `7.png`). If problem is a open question, locate its' answer with explanations in the `/exams-x.com/public/{subject}_{year}_{version}_answers` and name it after its' number. (for example: Answer of the problem N28 would be `28.png`)

### Step 4

Locate `{subject}.json` in the `/exams-x.com/src/data` directory and put every single problem inside them as a json. Each subject could have different format but Math has following:

```json
    {
      "year": 2023, // year of the test
      "version": 1, // version of the test
      "number": 2, // number of the problem
      "points": 1, // points of the problem
      "type": "closed", // type of the problem
      "answer": "áƒ“" // answer of the problem
    }, // or
    {
      "year": 2023,
      "version": 1,
      "number": 40,
      "points": 4,
      "type": "open", // if type of the problem is open
      "answer": ["40_1.png", "40_2.png"] // create array with names of the answer pictures you created in /{subject}_{year}_{version}_answers directory
    }
```
